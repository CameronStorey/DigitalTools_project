Research Project for Digital Tools for Fianance

TITLE: The effect of interest rates on Cryptocurrency.

The main purpose of our project is to investigate how interest rate changes made by tThe Federal Reserve effect the value of cryptocurrencies. To perform our analysis, we decided on three central banks and three cryptocurrencies to explore.


We will focus on the Federal Resevre and try to find any key events from various toher central banks that have caused impact on oiur cryptocurrency prices.


Cryptcurrency:
-Bitcoin.
-Dogecoin.
-Solana. 

These three cryptos give a good spread over the landscape of cyrptocurrencies. Bitcoin being the largest in market capitilisation and most popular, Dogecoin being a 'meme' coin attracting different demographics of crypto traders and Solana being a newer crypto with different underlying tech.


We hope to discover which coins are most impacted by the central bank interest rate changes and what effect these changes have.
