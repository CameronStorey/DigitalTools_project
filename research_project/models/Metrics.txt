Daily Range (will require a high and low, I think the data has that)

Moving Average - 5,10,20,50 days
 - moving average for both BTC price and the value of the daily range
 - want to look at the moving average on either side of the interest rate changes.

Volatility
 - Use a rolling window, similar to the moving average.
 - idea is that, do we see a spike in the volatility once we see a change in the interest rate.

We could also look at options for BTC, I think there is a market for them. We can consider the greeks - specifically rho which is the option price sensitivity to risk free interest.
