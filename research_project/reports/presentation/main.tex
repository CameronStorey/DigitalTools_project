\frametitle{Introduction}
The goal of this research report is to discover how changes in FED interest rates have an impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) \newline

We will look at multiple methods and see if there are any significant results with an aim to create a strategy we could use to successfully trade cyrptocurrency markets.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Our Code}
    The code we have developed within Python, we have used a range of python packages as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Pandas
    \item Numpy
    \item matplotlib
\end{itemize}
The following were used for our data handling, data analysis and our data visualisation.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Analysis Method}
We have based our analysis on correlation and trend analysis.\\

We obtained results based on a hypothesis testing method and tried to see if there were any significant results.\newline

Our results are shown in the following slides.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Findings, n day change}
We ran multiple methods the fist was an analysis of the price change n days after a FED rate change. We were looking to see if there is a significant move on a specific day. \\

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Findings, n day change}
We see no significant evidence of a price change in a certain direction on a specific day. So we will now perform a moving average analysis.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Findings, Moving Average}
As we observed no significant result we have moved onto Moving average in which we obtained the following data/results.

\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Findings, Moving Average}
Once again we see nothing significance so we will move onto volatility analysis.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Findings, Volatility}
We now chose to analyse if there is any effect on the volatility and daily change of the BTC price data when there is a FED rate change.

    \frametitle{Findings, Volatility}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{research_project/text/paper/10.png}     

\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Findings, Volatility}
Once again we see the FED rate change has no significant effect of the BTC price change or price Action, we see some significant results but we do not believe this is due to the FED changing the rate and more likely because of something else happening in the world and the market.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{LIBOR Correlation}
    We also ran an analysis on the correlation of the price of BTC and LIBOR (The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate)\newline
    
We observed in the short term (approximately the last year) a strong negative correlation, although in the long term we couldn't see any significant predictors and thus LIBOR is not indicative of price move magnitude or direction.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    In conclusion, while it is possible that changes in the FED rate could influence the demand for Bitcoin, there are also a number of other factors that can impact the cryptocurrency's price. These include things like global economic conditions, investor sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advances. As a result, it is difficult to draw a direct causal relationship between the FED rate and Bitcoin price.
